Oracle Database Instrumentation
-------------------------------
Author: Ryan Boucher, Peter Holland

These scripts are designed to be used with an oracle database with the goal of adding instrumentation for the purpose of discovering unknown behaviour.

These scripts are not in a state where they can be easily used against an oracle install but with a few minor changes they will work.

Please contact me if you want to use these scripts and I'll help where I can.
